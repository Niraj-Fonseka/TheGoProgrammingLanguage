Go is a compiled language 
Go natively handles Unicode, so it can process text in all world's languages 

Creating a executable binary 

go build helloworld.go

The import declaration must follow the package declaration, After that a program consists of the 
declarations of functions, variables , constants and types


var s  <- initilized to zeon if its not explicitly initilized

//While loop
for condition {

    //,,,
}


//Infinite loop
for {

}

Blank Identifier ( _ ) 
    - Used whenever syntax requires a variable name but program logic doesnt 
      ie : discard the index when we only need the element value


s : = "" 
    - can be used within a function 
    - not for package level 
var s string 
    - defailt initilization to the zeron value 
var s = ""
    - rarely used except for creating multiple varibales 
var s string = ""
    - explicit about the variable type 


// 1.3 
%d          --> decimal integer
%x, %o, %b  --> integer in hexadecimal, octal, binary
%f, %g, %e  --> floating-p oint number: 3.141593 3.141592653589793 3.141593e+00
%t          --> boolean: true or false
%c          --> rune (Unicode code point)
%s          --> string
%q          --> quoted string "abc" or rune 'c'
%v          --> any value in a natural for mat
%T          --> type of any value
%%          --> literal percent sign (no operand)

A map is a reference to the data structure created by make. When the map 
is passed to a function the function recives a copy of the reference.
